<h1>  About HTML and this quiz page</h1>
<p>I have created this quiz web page using web scripting technologies. Here is some information about these languages. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML"> <p class="linktext">This text is from the Wikipedia page on HTML</p></a>
<p>Some Key things I have learnt about HTML:
<ul>
<li>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
Most websites will contain these file types : </li>
<br>
<ol>
<li>.html (the bones of the content)</li>
<li> .css (the styles) </li>
<li> .js (any program or animation)</li> 
<li> .jpg or .png (image files) </li>
</ol>


</p>
<p><li>HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</li></p>

<p><li>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items.</li></p>

<p><li>HTML markup consists of several key components. The text in the BODY is the visible page content. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like H1, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example IMAGE. The first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</li></p>

<p>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration at the very beginning, which triggers standards mode rendering.</p> 

<p>I am proud of myself for learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s great to understand a bit about how the internet works because I use it everyday. I can now create and edit websites on my own. </p>
